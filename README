R implementation testing on rails using RinRuby

A prerequisite for RinRuby is a working installation of R:

   $ gem install rinruby

Regardless of the installation method, RinRuby is invoked within a Ruby/in rails controllers script (or the interactive "irb" prompt denoted >>) using:
  
   require "rinruby"

The app can upload the charts/graphs generated by R and also utilizes Morris (raphael.js dependency) javascript library to create dynamic graphs.
