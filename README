R implementation on rails using RinRuby

A prerequisite for RinRuby is a working installation of R:

   $ gem install rinruby

Regardless of the installation method, RinRuby is invoked within a Ruby/in rails controllers script (or the interactive "irb" prompt denoted >>) using:
  
  require "rinruby"
