API USAGE DOCUMENT

Basic Authentication: nil

Content Type :
   application/json

Body:
   You can pass json data
   
   sample json body

   {
     "email" : "test@yopmail.com", 
     "first_name" : "XXXX", 
     "last_name" : "XXXX"
    }

NOTE: Content Type should be set to application/json
Ruby on Rails stores an authenticity token for each session, and submits this token as a hidden form field in any POST request upon a form submission. It does this to authenticate that the request is actually coming as a form submission through the web site, as opposed to a random POST request generated from CURL or another tool. A 3rd party application developer certainly doesn't have a token assigned and therefore can't submit this via their API request.
Rails only checks for the authenticity token in the case of a form submission. If you submit your data as content-type application/json, then the token is not required. As a result you can set the content type appropriately and encode your input parameters as either xml or json.
